5. **Feedback Loop**: Get user feedback early and often

## Next Steps

1. **Choose Your Agent**: Select one of the suggested agents or define your own
2. **Set Up Environment**: Initialize Next.js project with Claude API
3. **Implement MVP**: Build basic functionality first
4. **Add Intelligence**: Implement chain-based reasoning
5. **Enhance Features**: Add optional tasks for bonus points
6. **Document Everything**: Create comprehensive documentation
7. **Prepare for Review**: Practice explaining your implementation
