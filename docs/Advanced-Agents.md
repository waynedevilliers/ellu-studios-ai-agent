# Advanced Agents with LangGraph

## Introduction

In earlier lessons, we built **reflection agents** and **multi-agents** with LangChain.  
Now we move into **advanced agents** using **LangGraph** — a framework designed for building more complex workflows with better **structure, visualization, and flexibility**.

Where **LangChain** is about chaining prompts and tools, **LangGraph** adds **graph-based workflow design** and **state management**, making it especially suited for **agentic applications**.

## What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is a framework for creating **agent workflows** using **graph data structures**.  
It focuses on:

- **Visualizing workflows**
- **Managing dependencies**
- **Optimizing execution paths**
- **Adapting dynamically** to state and inputs

Unlike LangChain’s sequential chains, LangGraph emphasizes **directed graphs** (DAGs) for **flexibility**.

## Key Concepts and Glossary

### State

- A **shared data structure** holding the current application snapshot.
- Often a **TypedDict** or **Pydantic model** (Python); in TypeScript, this translates to **interfaces or types**.
- Updated via **reducers** that merge new values.

### Nodes

- Functions representing logic or actions (e.g., an LLM call, API request, or tool).
- Receive **state**, return **updated state**.

### Edges

- Define **transitions** between nodes.
- Can be **conditional** (branching) or **fixed** (sequential).

### StateGraph

- The **main graph class** — a directed acyclic graph (DAG) driven by `State`.

### MessagesState

- Prebuilt state optimized for **chat-based agents**.

### Start & End Nodes

- **Start Node**: Entry point for input → determines which nodes trigger first.
- **End Node**: Exit point → signals termination of workflow.

## Graphs: A Refresher

Graphs are **data structures** with:

- **Vertices (Nodes)** = entities
- **Edges** = relationships between nodes

### Types

- **Directed vs. Undirected**
- **Weighted vs. Unweighted**
- **Cyclic vs. Acyclic (DAGs)**

### Real-World Examples

- Social networks → users & friendships
- Maps → cities & roads
- Web → pages & links

LangGraph uses **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)** to ensure predictable execution.

## LangChain vs. LangGraph

| Feature   | LangChain                             | LangGraph                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose   | Build LLM apps & tools                | Build **agent workflows** only                 |
| Structure | Sequential chains                     | Graph-based (DAGs)                             |
| Focus     | Prompt chaining, memory, integrations | State management, observability, visualization |
| Use Cases | Chatbots, RAGs, LLM utilities         | Multi-agent systems, adaptive workflows        |

## Ecosystem Overview

### LangChain Ecosystem

- **LangChain (core)** → modular building blocks for LLM apps
- **LangGraph (core)** → structured workflow orchestration
- **Integrations** → connect APIs, data sources, storage
- **LangGraph Cloud** → deploy & scale workflows (commercial)
- **LangSmith** → debugging, monitoring, testing, prompt management

Together, these form a **stack** for designing, running, and managing **agents at scale**.

### Agent Ecosystem Beyond LangGraph

Other Python/JS frameworks exist, e.g.:

- **CrewAI** → multi-agent coordination
- **AutoGen (Microsoft)** → conversational multi-agent systems
- **Parlai / Haystack / Semantic Kernel** → alternative orchestration tools

LangGraph is **opinionated for agent workflows**, while others may focus on **multi-agent orchestration** or **tooling**.

## Learning Path (LangChain Academy: LangGraph Course)

LangChain Academy offers a free **LangGraph course** with 6 modules:

1. **Introduction**
2. **State & Memory**
3. **UX & Human-in-the-Loop**
4. **Building Your Assistant**
5. **Long-Term Memory**
6. **Deployment**

> ⚡ Pro tip: Focus on **Next.js + TypeScript implementations**, not Python.  
> Use **graph-based state schemas with TypeScript interfaces** for clean design.

---

## Takeaways

- LangChain = **prompt workflows**
- LangGraph = **agent workflows**
- Agents need **state**, **nodes**, **edges**, and **observability**
- Graph-based design allows **branching, dynamic decisions, and flexible orchestration**
- The **ecosystem** (LangSmith, LangGraph Cloud, Integrations) supports scaling into production
