- Core components and their relationships
- Development phases and milestones
- Technology stack and decisions

### 3. Implementation Guidelines
Study **[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)** for:
- Technical setup and configuration
- Code standards and patterns
- Development phases breakdown
- Common issues and solutions

### 4. Security First
Master **[Security Guidelines](./Security-Guidelines.md)** covering:
- Input validation and prompt injection prevention
- Rate limiting and output sanitization
- Environment security and API protection
- Security testing requirements

### 5. Quality Assurance
Implement **[Testing Strategy](./Testing-Strategy.md)** including:

- Coverage requirements and test organization
- Performance testing and CI/CD setup

## 🎯 Quick Reference

### Development Phases
1. **Phase 1: Foundation** (4-6 hours) - Security layer, basic Claude API integration
2. **Phase 2: Agent Chains** (6-8 hours) - Multi-step reasoning capabilities
3. **Phase 3: Advanced Tools** (8-10 hours) - External API integration, sandboxed execution
4. **Phase 4: Memory System** (6-8 hours) - Persistent context and learning

### Key Security Requirements
- ✅ All inputs validated with Zod schemas
- ✅ Prompt injection detection implemented
- ✅ Rate limiting configured
- ✅ Output sanitization applied
- ✅ Environment variables secured
- ✅ Security tests with >95% coverage

### Testing Requirements
- ✅ Overall coverage >80%
- ✅ Security functions >95% coverage
- ✅ Core agent logic >90% coverage
- ✅ API routes >85% coverage

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### 1. Setup Phase
```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add your Claude API key to .env.local
```

### 2. Security First Development
- Create security components first (`lib/security/`)
- Implement input validation and prompt injection detection
- Write comprehensive security tests

### 3. Core Agent Development
- Build agent orchestration (`lib/agent/core.ts`)
- Implement chains and tools
- Add memory management

### 4. API Layer
- Create secure API routes (`app/api/`)
- Implement proper error handling
- Add rate limiting and logging

### 5. User Interface
- Build chat interface components
- Add loading states and error handling
- Implement real-time updates

### 6. Testing & Validation
- Write unit tests for all functions
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- Create comprehensive security test suite
- Performance testing for response times

## 📊 Success Criteria

### Core Requirements (Must Have)
- ✅ Agent processes user messages safely
- ✅ Multi-step reasoning with chains works
- ✅ Tools execute in sandboxed environments
- ✅ Memory persists across sessions
- ✅ All security tests pass
- ✅ >80% test coverage achieved

### Advanced Features (Should Have)
- ✅ Multiple tool integrations
- ✅ Advanced memory capabilities
- ✅ Performance optimizations
- ✅ Production deployment ready

## 💡 Tips for Success

### 1. Security is Not Optional
- Implement security measures from day one
- Never skip input validation or sanitization
- Test security components thoroughly
- Log security events for monitoring

### 2. Test Everything
- Write tests before implementing features
- Maintain high coverage standards
- Focus heavily on security testing
- Use CI/CD to enforce quality gates

### 3. Incremental Development
- Start with basic functionality
- Add complexity gradually
- Validate each phase before moving forward
- Document architectural decisions

### 4. Performance Matters
- Monitor response times from the start
- Implement caching strategically
- Handle concurrent requests efficiently
- Plan for scaling needs
