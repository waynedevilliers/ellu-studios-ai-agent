## Conversation Flow Design

### Sample Conversations

#### New Visitor Flow
```
Agent: "Willkommen bei ELLU Studios! ðŸ‘‹ I'm here to help you discover the perfect pattern making journey. Are you new to fashion design, or do you have some experience already?"

User: "I'm completely new but really interested in learning"

Agent: "Wonderful! Starting your fashion journey is so exciting. To recommend the perfect path for you, I'd love to know - what draws you to pattern making? Is this for personal enjoyment, or are you thinking about a career change?"

User: "I'm thinking about a career change actually"

Agent: "That's fantastic! Career changes in fashion can be incredibly rewarding. Let me ask a few quick questions to create your personalized learning plan:

1. How much time can you dedicate to learning each week?
2. Do you prefer precise, technical approaches or more creative, intuitive methods?  
3. What type of garments excite you most?"

[After assessment]

Agent: "Perfect! Based on your answers, I recommend our **Foundation to Professional Journey**:

ðŸ“š **Phase 1 (Months 1-2)**: Klassische Schnittkonstruktion
â†’ Master precise German pattern construction methods

ðŸ§µ **Phase 2 (Months 3-4)**: Professional Sewing Techniques  
â†’ Bring your patterns to life with expert construction

ðŸŽ¨ **Phase 3 (Months 5-6)**: Specialization Choice
â†’ Choose your focus: sustainable design, digital tools, or advanced draping

**Goal**: Be ready to work as a pattern maker or start your own design business

Would you like me to:
ðŸ“… Schedule a free consultation to discuss this path?
ðŸ“§ Send detailed course information to your email?
ðŸ’¬ Answer any questions about the curriculum?"
```

#### Course Comparison Flow
```
User: "What's the difference between construction and draping?"

Agent: "Excellent question! These are two fundamental approaches to pattern making:

**Klassische Schnittkonstruktion** (Construction):
âœ“ Mathematical, precise approach
âœ“ Perfect for structured garments (suits, coats, fitted dresses)  
âœ“ German engineering precision - very systematic
âœ“ Great foundation for technical fashion careers

**Schnittkonstruktion durch Drapieren** (Draping):
âœ“ Creative, intuitive approach
âœ“ Perfect for flowing, artistic designs (evening wear, avant-garde)
âœ“ Parisian atelier techniques - very artistic
âœ“ Excellent for creative fashion careers

Many of our students take both for complete mastery! Which style resonates more with your creative vision - precision or artistic flow?"
```
