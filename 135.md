## Fair Use of AI

AI is now a powerful tool that can be applied in most fields, including web development. While we encourage you to use AI, we also want to make sure you are a capable developer and don’t become over reliant. You can read [this page](https://turingcollege.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/LG2/pages/2016575532/AI+tools+e.g.+ChatGPT+in+learning) for guidance on using ChatGPT to assist with your learning. 


We expect you to understand and to be able to explain and edit the code in your submitted projects. During reviews you will be asked to explain and change or fix a part of your project. So, as long as you understand and are able to clearly explain and modify everything you’re delivering, you should be in the clear.

Here are some tips for using AI:



* You can use AI to help solve bugs or problems
    * First, use AI when you get stuck on novel errors. An AI chatbot can explain what the error means. Then try to figure out yourself what in your code is causing it. If you are still stuck, ask AI to explain the problem in more detail and/or propose a solution.
* Anytime AI writes code that you want to use, you must understand how it works before moving on.
    * Read the provided code snippets, then try to implement them step-by-step only using the provided code as a guide. This way you will learn how to build the solution from the ground up, instead of relying on a code block that you are afraid to edit yourself.

    <summary>Python</summary>

You can use Python with Streamlit for the front end and any Python libraries that help you build your agent. The choice of libraries and tools is up to you, based on what your agent needs to do.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
    <summary>JavaScript</summary>

We recommend using Next.js, and in particular <a href="https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-nextjs-template">the Next.js LangChain starter template</a>. It includes an example of how to use agents in a Next.js project. You can implement your agent using JavaScript and integrate it with the agent framework.

</details>

**The intended code editor for this project is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).**

**If you feel confident, feel free to over-engineer the app by adding different things from the optional tasks and coming up with your own things. You can try making it as a portfolio project!**

Remember, you have all the tools at your disposal: ChatGPT, StackOverflow, or a friend!

# Task Requirements

The exact task requirements are as follows:

1. **Agent Purpose**:
    * Define a clear purpose for your agent
    * Explain why this agent is useful
    * Identify the target users

2. **Core Functionality**:
    * Implement the main features that make your agent useful
    * Ensure the agent can perform its primary tasks effectively
    * Include necessary user interactions

3. **User Interface**:
    * Build a user-friendly interface for all functionalities
    * Make the interface intuitive and easy to use

4. **Technical Implementation**:
    * Use appropriate tools and libraries
    * Implement proper error handling
    * Ensure the agent can handle real-world usage

5. **Documentation**:
    * Provide clear documentation on how to use your agent
    * Include examples of common use cases
    * Explain any technical decisions made

## Optional Tasks

After the main functionality is implemented and your code works correctly, and you feel that you want to upgrade your project, choose various improvements from this list.
The list is sorted by difficulty levels. 

**Caution: Some of the tasks in medium or hard categories may contain tasks with concepts or libraries that may be introduced in later sections or even require outside knowledge/time to research outside of the course.**

**Easy:**
1. Ask ChatGPT to critique your solution from the usability, security, and prompt-engineering sides.
2. Give the agent a personality—tweak responses to make them more formal, friendly, or concise based on user needs.
3. Provide the user with the ability to choose from a list of LLMs (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.) for this project.
4. Add all of the OpenAI settings (temperature, top-p frequency) for the user to tune as sliders/fields.
5. Add a feature to allow users to preview the dataset before and after cleaning.
6. Add an interactive help feature or chatbot guide.


**Medium:**

1. Calculate and display token usage and costs.
2. Add retry logic for agents.
3. Implement long-term or short-term memory in LangChain/LangGraph.
4. Implement one more function tool that would call an external API.
5. Add user authentication and personalization.
6. Implement a caching mechanism to store and retrieve frequently used responses.
7. Implement a feedback loop where users can rate the responses, and use this feedback to improve the agent's performance.
8. Implement 2 extra function tools (5 in total). Have a UI for the user to either enable or disable these function tools. Develop a plugin system that allows users to add or remove functionalities from the chatbot dynamically.
9. Implement multi-model support (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).

**Hard:**

1. Agentic RAG: Think of a way to add RAG functionality to the LangChain/LangGraph application and implement it.
2. Add one off these LLM observability tools: Arize Pheonix, LangSmith, Lunary, or others.
3. Make your solution scalable, meaning that you can clean large CSV files: 500MB or even in the GB range.
4. Fine-tune the model for your specific domain.
5. Create an agent that can learn from user feedback on the cleaned dataset. This agent should be able to adjust its cleaning strategies based on the feedback to improve future performance.
6. Implement an agent that can integrate with external data sources to enrich the dataset. This could involve fetching additional data from APIs or databases.
7. Implement an agent that can collaborate with other agents in a distributed system. This agent should be able to work with agents running on different machines or in different environments, coordinating their efforts to clean the dataset efficiently.

8. Deploy your app to the cloud with proper scaling.

# How to get started with Streamlit (Python)

It is very likely that you are seeing and hearing about Streamlit for the first time. No worries!

It's a fantastic framework for creating interactive web apps using Python, particularly for **data visualization**, **machine learning demos**, and **quick prototyping**.

You don't need to know much about front-end things, like HTML, CSS, JS, React, or others, to build apps! Streamlit will do the basics of the front-end for you by just writing Python code.

**Learning Streamlit:**

* You can get started by watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0D4Pa22iG0&ab_channel=pixegami). 
* After that, check out their [page](https://streamlit.io/). 
* Check their documentation on [page elements](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference). 
* A good starting point could be their ["Get Started" section](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started).
* Lastly, GeeksForGeeks also offers a good tutorial on [Streamlit](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-beginners-guide-to-streamlit/).
* [YouTube short.](https://youtube.com/shorts/iPj6QKMd8qA?si=d0i19vdfr3x4jAn0)
* Tutorial on using Streamlit in [VS Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2siBrMsqF44&ab_channel=TechWithTim).

## How to use Next.js for agents (JS)

You can either choose one of the following:

- Next.js from scratch, either `create-next-app` or the project template from the previous project
- (Recommended) <a href="https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-nextjs-template">LangChain's Next.js template</a>
- some other JS full-stack framework or a Python backend + JS frontend project

We recommend using the LangChain's Next.js template and its <a href="https://langchain-nextjs-template.vercel.app/agents">agents example</a> in particular. You will be primarily working with the `app/api/chat/agents/route.ts` file.

For Next.js we expect you to integrate the "Upload document" functionality, which would allow uploading a CSV file for data cleaning.

## Approach to solving the task

* 1-5 hours of attempting to solve the task using your own knowledge + ChatGPT. It is encouraged to use ChatGPT both for:
    * Understanding this task better
    * Writing the code
    * Improving the code
    * Understanding the code
* If you feel that some knowledge is missing, please revisit the parts in the previous sprints and check out additional resources.
* Feel free to revisit the various Google Colab notebooks in Sprint 3. They can help you to understand agents better.
* If during the first 1-2 hours you see you are making no progress and that the task seems much too hard for you, we recommend 10 more hours working on the problem with help from peers and JTLs.
* Out of these 10 hours, you are expected to spend about half of them working with someone else—whether it is peer study buddies, peers who have completed the exercise and want to help you, or JTLs in open sessions.
* If you still can't solve it, check the suggested solution and spend as much time as needed (also based on what you have available until the next deadline) to understand it.
